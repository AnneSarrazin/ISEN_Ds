    "# Cycle Sharing Scheme—Determining Brand Persona\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nancy** and **Eric** were assigned with the huge task of determining the brand persona for a new cycle share scheme. They had to present their results at this year’s annual board meeting in order to lay out a strong marketing plan for reaching out to potential customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cycle sharing scheme provides means for the people of the city to commute using a convenient, cheap, and green transportation alternative. The service has 500 bikes at 50 stations across Seattle. Each of the stations has a dock locking system (where all bikes are parked); kiosks (so customers can get a membership key or pay for a trip); and a helmet rental service. A person can choose between purchasing a membership key or short-term pass. A membership key entitles an annual membership, and the key can be obtained from a kiosk. Advantages for members include quick retrieval of bikes and unlimited 45-minute rentals. Short-term passes offer access to bikes for a 24-hour or 3-day time interval. Riders can avail and return the bikes at any of the 50 stations citywide.\n"

    "_What do I mean by exploratory data analysis (EDA) ? Well, by this I mean to see the data visually. Why do we need to see the data visually? Well, considering that you have 1 million observations in your dataset then it won’t be easy for you to understand the data just by looking at it, so it would be better to plot it visually. But don’t you think it’s a waste of time? No not at all, because understanding the data lets us understand the importance of features and their limitations._\n",
